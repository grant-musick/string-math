# string-subtraction
Based on interview problem I came across recently.

Basic problem is as follows:

Suppose you have two numbers that need to be represented as strings. How
would you subract them? Note the example assumes positive subtrahend and
minuend but not a postive answer.

For example:

"73" - "24" = "49"

"15" - "42" = "-27"


The Python version of this (only one so far) has multiple test cases. The ones that
apply to the core interview question are active. The ones that would be "extra credit"
to solve are marked to be ignored. I may get around to solving the general case but
the purpose of this exercise was mostly to solve the specific case from the interview
and play around with some Python features I had not used much.

To get a printed type: 'python string_subtraction.py'

To run the tests type: 'python -m unittest string_subtraction'


There is also a way to do this with twos complement but that is not this code...yet.
